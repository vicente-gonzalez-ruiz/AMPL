Exercise 2:

Variables: X_ij -> amount to transport from S_i to T_j (continuous)
Objective: mininize cost: sum_ij C_ij * X_ij where C_ij = unit transportation cost from S_i to T_j
Subject to: x_ij >= 0 for all i,j
Subject to: (capacity) supply: sum_j X_ij<= s_i where s_i is the capacity of S_i for all i
Subject to: demand: sum_i X_ij = d_j where d_j is the demand of T_j
