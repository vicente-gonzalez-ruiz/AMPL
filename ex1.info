We assume that there are n type of possible products to produce, and b hours
for the production. For every products the profit per unit, the maximum
quantity to produce and how much product we produce in an hour is given. Maximize
the profit!

What is the mathematical model?


Having 2 product, t1 and t2, with profit 25 and 30 Ft, maximum number of pieces are
6000 and 4000, respectively, how much should we make for maximal profit?
In one hour 200 and 140 piece can be produced, if only one type of product is made 
and 40 hours are available for production.
