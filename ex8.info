CPU Scheduling

10 tasks must be run on 3 CPUs at 1.33, 2 and 2.66 GHz 
(each processor can run only one task at a time). The 
number of elementary operations of the tasks (expressed 
in billions of instructions (BI)) is as follows:

1.1	2.1	3	1	0.7	5	3	3.5	4	1.5

Schedule tasks to processors so that the completion time of 
the last task is minimized. Solve the problem with AMPL.
