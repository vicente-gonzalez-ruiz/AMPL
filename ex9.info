Curve Fitting

A quantity y is known to depend upon another quantity x. A set of
corresponding vaules has been collected for x and y and is presented
in the table:

(1) Fit the `best' straight line y = bx + a to this set of data
points. The objective is to minimize the sum of absolute deviations of
each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear
relationship.

(2) Fit the `best' straight line where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

(3) Fit the `best' quadratic curve y = cx^2 + bx + a to this set of data points using the same objectives as in (1) and (2).
